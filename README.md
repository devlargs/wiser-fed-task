# Wiser Frontend Task — Figma to Build (Pixel Perfect)

Thanks for taking the time to do this short frontend exercise.

The goal of this task is to assess how you translate a Figma design into a clean, accurate frontend build — focusing on layout, spacing, typography, and attention to detail.

---

## 🧩 Task

You’ll be given a Figma frame of a job listing layout.

Your job is to build this UI as closely as possible in **Next.js**, matching the design pixel-perfectly.

This is intentionally a small component-focused task.

---

## ✅ What to build

Build:

- A **Job Listing** component that renders multiple rows
- A **Job Row** component that matches the Figma layout
- Each row should include:
  - Job title
  - Team
  - Brand/logo placeholder text
  - Location
  - “View job” button/link

Mock job data is already provided.

## 🗂 Where to work

The starter project is already set up.

You’ll mainly be editing:

- `app/components/JobListing/JobListing.tsx`
- `app/components/JobRow/JobRow.tsx`
- `app/components/JobListing/JobListing.module.scss`
- `app/components/JobRow/JobRow.module.scss`

The mock data lives here:

- `data/mockJobs.ts`

## 🎯 What we’re looking for

This task is mostly about design accuracy:

- Grid/alignment
- Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
- Typography hierarchy
- Button styling
- Clean, readable component structure
- Optional: hover states or small UX improvements if you have time.

No need to over-engineer — keep it simple.

Feel free to stick with system fonts — no need to match the exact typeface.

---

## ⏱ Time expectation

Please spend no more than **30–60 minutes**.

We’d rather see a smaller piece done really well than lots of unfinished extras.
